## Issue
Getting "The requested network is not enabled for this API key" error when trying to connect with Google through Enoki zkLogin.

## Current Configuration
- Enoki API Key: `enoki_public_67909d6d237711073e5a665279fb80da`
- Google Client ID: `657122842973-0f7v36gt2irp9k4b0eq559qrm2npvamh.apps.googleusercontent.com`
- Network: **testnet** ‚úÖ (UPDATED)
- Facebook Client ID: (empty)

## ‚úÖ SOLUTIONS IMPLEMENTED

### **Option 1: Network Fix**
Changed network from `mainnet` to `testnet` in `providers.tsx`:
```tsx
<SuiClientProvider networks={networkConfig} defaultNetwork="testnet">
```

### **Option 2: Development Fallback**
Added automatic fallback to development mode when Enoki API fails:
- Creates mock user for testing
- Still creates user document in Firestore
- Allows testing of staff management features

## üéØ **What Should Happen Now**

1. **Try Google Sign-In** - if API key works with testnet, normal flow
2. **If API key fails** - automatically switches to development mode
3. **User document created** in Firestore either way
4. **Staff management works** regardless

## üìä **Expected Console Output**

### **Success Case:**
```
üîß Enoki Registration Debug:
Network: testnet
Is Enoki Network: true
‚úÖ Registering Enoki wallets...
‚úÖ Enoki wallets registered successfully
```

### **Development Fallback Case:**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Enoki API key issue detected. Offering development fallback...
‚úÖ Development mode: User created successfully!
```

### Check Enoki Dashboard
Verify in your [Enoki Dashboard](https://enoki.mystenlabs.com/) that:
- Your project is active
- The API key is valid
- The correct networks are enabled
- Google OAuth is properly configured
